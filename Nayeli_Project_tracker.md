I worked on a template for the proposal aand share it with my classmates.

**Date: January 20th, 2024**

We meet at the library and work 2 hours refining the proposal and discussing useful functionalities for our project.

**Date: January 25th, 2024**

- Our partner Karthiga explained us how to create a project in RStudio and tied it with Git and GitHub.
- We discuss about the wrapping functions and split the work evenly.
- I created my firts wrapping function call "get_channel_stats" to retrieve information about the channel based on a list of channel ids.

**Date: January 27th, 2024**

- I modify the get_channel_stats function to get the channel start date and add a column indicating if the thumbnails were present.
- I add the first version of the channel_comparator_visualizations code with a proposal of a variety of graphs to:
    1. Horizontal bar graps to show the count of views, subscribers and videos for every channel name.
    2. Bubble plot to show the relationship among number of views, number of subscribers and total videos per channel name.
    3. An scatterplot to show the channel growth base on the number of views, subscribers and total video per channel name.
    4. An horizontal bar plot to explore the contribution of each channel to the overall engagement (number of subscribers / number of viewers).
